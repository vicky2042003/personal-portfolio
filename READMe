## About:
I am Yogesh Bangar, a Third Year computer science student from Maharashtra, India.

I am intrested in front-end design, I like the ways in which visual aids elegantly help to convey a message across the audience.
For this site I've used static content to demonstrate my experiments with these technologies.
